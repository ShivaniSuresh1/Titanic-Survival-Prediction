# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
## Overview

This Python project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques with the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivaniSuresh1/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

2. **Download the Titanic dataset:**

   Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and place the CSV files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) in the "data" directory.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic-Predictor.ipynb
   ```

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Explore and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, feature engineering, and data cleaning.

## Model Training

- Train machine learning models on the preprocessed data to predict passenger survival.

## Results and Evaluation

- After running the code, the trained model will be saved, and predictions will be made on the test set.
- Evaluation metrics and visualizations will assess the model's performance.

## Project Details

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
